# TinyFX
Small OpenGL ES3.1+ renderer inspired by [BGFX](https://github.com/bkaradzic/bgfx). Currently master does not work on GLES2, use `gles2` branch instead. This should be fixed in the future.

## Features
- Reorders draw calls to minimize state changes and avoid overdraw (in progress)
- Deals with the dirty details of the graphics API for you
- Bring-your-own-framework style renderer. Doesn't tell you how to architect your program
- Tracks and resets state for you between draws
- Out-of-order submission to views (i.e. render passes)
- Uniforms separate from shader objects, all shader programs with matching uniforms are updated automatically
- Compute shaders
- OpenGL ES 3.1+ (ES2 supported in `gles2` branch)
- OpenGL 4.3+ core (as low as 3.1 should work, but isn't regularly tested)
- Supports stereo rendering for VR (integration is up to you, but the tools are there!)

## FAQ
### *Who is this for?*
Anyone sick of remembering when you need barriers, implementing a state tracker for the 50th time, integrating bigger deps than your entire codebase or who just wants something less of a pain to use than OpenGL is.

### *Why not use BGFX?*
BGFX is excellent, but we have different priorities and scope.

## Using TinyFX
1. Include `tinyfx.c` in your build
2. Add the location of `tinyfx.h` (and `tinyfx.hpp` if you use the C++ API) to your include paths
3. `#include <tinyfx.h>` or `#include <tinyfx.hpp>` and start using tfx after creating an OpenGL context (GLFW and SDL are good for this!). Remember to call `tfx_set_platform_data` with your target GL version first!
